# PM Codex

*Principles of PM excellence. Curated, opinionated, and designed to grow with you.*

This document ships with a starter set of principles drawn from top PMs, founders, and hard-won lessons from the field. Over time, your agent will suggest additions based on strong judgment calls you make in real work. The best entries come from real decisions, not textbooks. Make this yours.

## On Decisions

**Three owners means no owner.** Assign one person who decides AND owns the outcome. Consultants give input, they don't co-decide. *(Gokul Rajaram / SPADE)*

**Reversible decisions should be made fast.** The cost of delay often exceeds the cost of being wrong. Invest diligence proportional to irreversibility, not importance. A wrong decision you can undo in a week doesn't deserve a week of deliberation. *(Jeff Bezos / Type 1 vs Type 2)*

**Log the "why," not just the "what."** Anyone can record what was decided. The reasoning is what prevents relitigating in month 3. If you can't articulate why, you haven't actually decided — you've just picked.

**Indecision is the most expensive decision.** A clear "no" is better than a wishy-washy "maybe later." Indecision stalls teams, creates ambiguity, and forces everyone downstream to hedge. Even a wrong decision unblocks people. *(Ami Vora)*

**Decisions compound.** The decision you make today becomes context for the decision you make next month. That's why logging matters — not for accountability, but for coherence. A PM with no decision history makes each call in isolation. A PM with a decision log makes each call in context.

## On Prioritization

**Prioritization without a priority is just a list.** Before ranking anything, name what you're optimizing for. If the answer is "everything," you haven't started.

**Scores are vibes with a formula.** Numerical scoring systems produce the window dressing of objectivity on top of subjective inputs. Articulate tradeoffs in plain language instead. "This helps retention but delays the platform work" is more honest and more useful than "RICE score: 47."

**Killing is a decision, not an omission.** Explicitly deciding NOT to do something — and capturing why — is as valuable as deciding what to do. Items that silently fall off the backlog get relitigated. Items that are killed with reasoning stay dead. *(Adriel Frederick)*

**"Not yet" is underrated.** Pure "no" feels final and dismissive. "Not yet, because X, but let's revisit when Y" keeps doors open and signals you're sequencing, not gate-keeping. It's the softest form of "no" that still protects your team's focus.

**Bet big on fewer things.** Spreading resources across many small initiatives feels safe and delivers nothing. High-impact bets require concentrated effort. If everything is a priority, nothing ships well. *(Adriel Frederick, Brendan Foody)*

## On Stakeholders & Influence

**Managing up is managing fear.** Executives are scared of missing targets, looking bad to the board, and being blindsided. The PM who manages up well reduces their fear. Surface problems early, even before you have solutions. "I'm seeing a risk and I'm working on it" beats silence until explosion.

**No surprises is the prime directive.** Execs will forgive bad news. They will not forgive being blindsided by bad news. Ever. *(Deb Liu, Melissa Perri)*

**Understand their scoreboard.** What is your exec measured on? What keeps them up at night? If you don't know, find out. Frame everything in terms of their success metrics, not yours. You're playing in their game, not inviting them to yours.

**Create wins they can take credit for.** Execs need to look good too. When something goes well, give them the headline. They'll remember who makes them look good — and they'll protect what makes them look good. *(Alisa Cohn)*

**Influence without authority is real — and exhausting.** It works, but every initiative requires persuasion work. That's a tax people with formal authority don't pay. Manage your influence budget: spend it on decisions that matter, let small stuff go even when you're right.

**Authority is earned in moments, not meetings.** The PM who steps up during a crisis, makes a hard call that works out, or catches something everyone missed — that PM gets informal authority. Look for those moments. *(Alisa Cohn, Adam Fishman)*

**Borrowed authority is strategic, not political.** "My VP and I discussed this and..." isn't name-dropping — it's coalition-building. Align with someone who has the authority you need before you need it.

**Don't confuse access with alignment.** Just because an exec said "great idea" in a hallway doesn't mean they're committed. Follow up. Get explicit buy-in. People forget hallway conversations; they remember written commitments.

## On Discovery & Evidence

**"Customers want X" requires a source.** How do you know? Did you talk to them? See data? Or are you projecting your own intuition? All three are valid — but name which one you're using. Confidence should track evidence, not enthusiasm. *(Teresa Torres)*

**Talk to customers continuously, not in batches.** Discovery isn't a phase — it's a habit. One customer conversation per week beats a quarterly research sprint. The PM who talked to a customer yesterday makes better calls than the PM who ran a survey last quarter. *(Teresa Torres / Continuous Discovery Habits)*

**The best PRD provokes disagreement.** If everyone reads your PRD and nods, it's either obvious or vague. A good PRD forces people to engage with tradeoffs. "Wait, we're really not doing Y?" means the scope is clear.

**Narrow and excellent beats broad and mediocre.** This applies to MVPs, launches, and scope decisions. Better to have one killer feature that works great than five mediocre ones. Build trust through quality, not breadth — especially with AI products where a bad first experience poisons future trust.

**Evals are the new acceptance criteria.** For AI products, traditional QA isn't enough. You need evals — specific scenarios with expected outcomes that tell you whether the system is good enough. Build them before you build features. Lead with evals when pitching to skeptics; rigor is more persuasive than demos. *(Aishwarya Naresh Reganti)*

## On Working with Engineers

**Provide context, not instructions.** Engineers don't want to be told what to build. They want to understand WHY, and then figure out HOW. The PM who shares the problem space and lets engineers co-author the solution gets 10x the engagement of the PM who hands over a spec. *(Ryan Singer, Ami Vora)*

**Be present, not hovering.** Show up during dev cycles. Know what's happening. But don't optimize for control — optimize for removing obstacles. The best PM question isn't "is it on track?" — it's "what's blocking you?" *(Melissa Perri)*

**Respect the craft.** Engineering has standards of excellence that exist independent of product goals. Architecture decisions, code quality, testing practices — these are engineering's domain. The PM who respects that boundary earns trust. The PM who overrides it burns it.

**Process is tax, not value.** Sprint ceremonies, story point negotiations, commit meetings — these are PM artifacts that engineers tolerate. Minimize them. Every process you remove that doesn't break anything is a gift to your team. The goal is shipping, not ceremony.

**Encode your judgment, don't just present it.** In the AI era, the PM's value shifts from "person who tells the team what to build" to "person who encodes context, standards, and judgment into systems that scale without the PM being in the room." A standards doc that prevents 50 bad PRs is worth more than 50 code reviews.

**Frame POCs as questions, not answers.** If you're a builder-PM who prototypes, present your work as exploration: "I built this to test an assumption — does the approach make sense?" not "I solved this, now make it production-ready." The first invites collaboration. The second assigns work.

## On Shipping & Momentum

**Velocity compounds.** A team that ships something small this week learns faster than a team that plans something big for next quarter. Each release generates data, feedback, and momentum. Perfectionism is the enemy of learning.

**Mistakes from movement are fixable. Mistakes from stagnation are invisible.** You'll never know what you missed by not shipping. You'll always know what you learned by shipping something imperfect. The risk calculus favors action.

**Implicit mandates run on momentum.** If you're operating without formal authority or budget — and many PMs are — your license to operate depends on visible progress. The moment you stop shipping, someone starts questioning whether your initiative should exist. Keep the drumbeat going. *(Hard-won lesson)*

**Demo > deck.** A working demo persuades in ways a slide deck never will. Execs have seen a thousand roadmap slides. They haven't seen your thing actually working. When possible, show — don't tell.

**Ship the story, not just the feature.** A feature without a narrative is a checkbox. "We shipped dark mode" is boring. "We reduced reported eye strain by 40% and churn in our power user segment dropped" is a story. Every release should have a one-line narrative ready.

---

## On Communication

**Match the channel.** A Slack reply that reads like a memo destroys trust. An email to leadership that reads like a Slack message undermines credibility. Same information, different packaging. The format is part of the message.

**Lead with the headline.** Executives read subject lines and first sentences. Peers read the first paragraph. Engineers read the requirements. Structure accordingly — most important information first, details below the fold.

**Tailor to the audience, not the content.** The same project update gets framed differently for your VP (outcomes and risks), your eng lead (specs and blockers), and your peer PM (honest status). If you're sending the same update to three people, you're doing it wrong. *(Deb Liu)*

**Saying no is a prioritization skill. Saying no well is a leadership skill.** Every "no" is a micro-withdrawal from a trust bank. The best PMs invest the savings — if you decline someone's request, proactively look for a way to say "yes" to something else they care about soon after. Keep the relationship account balanced.

## On Product Thinking

**Compound context beats smart search.** The PM who has 3 months of accumulated, cross-referenced context about their product, stakeholders, and decisions makes better calls than the PM who can search faster. Build systems that compound, not just retrieve.

**Problem first, technology second.** Don't pitch the technology — pitch the problem it solves. "AI Copilot" is a feature. "Reducing support tickets by helping users self-serve complex workflows" is a product. This applies to every technology hype cycle, not just AI. *(Multiple sources)*

**The best products make the user's existing behavior easier, not different.** Asking users to change their workflow is expensive. Meeting them where they already work is cheap. This is why integrations beat platforms and why "just add it to the tool they're already in" usually wins.

**Ambition should be tracked, not just stated.** It's easy to say "we want to be world-class." It's hard to define what 7-star looks like vs. 5-star, and then track how your baseline shifts upward over time. Structured ambition — where you define the ladder and measure progress on it — turns vision from a poster on the wall into a tool for prioritization. *(Brian Chesky / 11-Star Experience)*

## On Working with AI

**Be the editor, not the creator.** AI generates, you refine. The 70% first draft that you sharpen into a 95% document is faster and better than starting from scratch. Your judgment is the value-add, not your typing speed.

**Write for two audiences.** Every requirement, every spec, every PRD is now read by humans (for alignment) and agents (for execution). "Make it intuitive" fails the agent. "Three steps, each under 60 seconds, with progress indication" serves both.

**Pair everything.** Not just programming — pair write, pair analyze, pair task-manage. For every task, ask: can AI just do this for me (automation), or should AI be helping me do this (augmentation)? The answer changes per task, and getting it right is a skill.

**Context is the new code.** The PM who encodes product context, team dynamics, and decision history into structured files doesn't just have a better memory — they have a better AI. Every piece of context you capture makes every future AI interaction more valuable. This is the compound advantage.

**AI products are probabilistic, not deterministic.** You can't guarantee output the way you can with traditional software. Quality means "works well enough across a distribution of scenarios," not "works exactly as specified." This changes how you test, how you set expectations, and how you communicate with stakeholders.
