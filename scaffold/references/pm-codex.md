# PM Codex

*Principles of PM excellence. Curated, opinionated, and designed to grow with you.*

This document ships with a starter set of principles. Over time, your agent will suggest additions based on strong judgment calls you make in real work. The best entries come from real decisions, not textbooks. Make this yours.

## On Decisions

**Three owners means no owner.** Assign one person who decides AND owns the outcome. Consultants give input, they don't co-decide. (Gokul Rajaram / SPADE)

**Reversible decisions should be made fast.** The cost of delay often exceeds the cost of being wrong. Invest diligence proportional to irreversibility, not importance. A wrong decision you can undo in a week doesn't deserve a week of deliberation.

**Log the "why," not just the "what."** Anyone can record what was decided. The reasoning is what prevents relitigating in month 3. If you can't articulate why, you haven't actually decided — you've just picked.

## On Prioritization

**Prioritization without a priority is just a list.** Before ranking anything, name what you're optimizing for. If the answer is "everything," you haven't started.

**Scores are vibes with a formula.** Numerical scoring systems produce the window dressing of objectivity on top of subjective inputs. Articulate tradeoffs in plain language instead. "This helps retention but delays the platform work" is more honest and more useful than "RICE score: 47."

**Killing is a decision, not an omission.** Explicitly deciding NOT to do something — and capturing why — is as valuable as deciding what to do. Items that silently fall off the backlog get relitigated. Items that are killed with reasoning stay dead.

## On Communication

**Match the channel.** A Slack reply that reads like a memo destroys trust. An email to leadership that reads like a Slack message undermines credibility. Same information, different packaging. The format is part of the message.

**Lead with the headline.** Executives read subject lines and first sentences. Peers read the first paragraph. Engineers read the requirements. Structure accordingly — most important information first, details below the fold.

**Tailor to the audience, not the content.** The same project update gets framed differently for your VP (outcomes and risks), your eng lead (specs and blockers), and your peer PM (honest status). If you're sending the same update to three people, you're doing it wrong.

## On Product Thinking

**"Customers want X" requires evidence.** How do you know? Did you talk to them? See data? Or are you projecting your own intuition? All three are valid — but name which one you're using. Confidence should track evidence, not enthusiasm.

**The best PRD provokes disagreement.** If everyone reads your PRD and nods, it's either obvious or vague. A good PRD forces people to engage with tradeoffs. "Wait, we're really not doing Y?" means the scope is clear.

**Compound context beats smart search.** The PM who has 3 months of accumulated, cross-referenced context about their product, stakeholders, and decisions makes better calls than the PM who can search faster. Build systems that compound, not just retrieve.

## On Working with AI

**Be the editor, not the creator.** AI generates, you refine. The 70% first draft that you sharpen into a 95% document is faster and better than starting from scratch. Your judgment is the value-add, not your typing speed.

**Write for two audiences.** Every requirement, every spec, every PRD is now read by humans (for alignment) and agents (for execution). "Make it intuitive" fails the agent. "Three steps, each under 60 seconds, with progress indication" serves both.
